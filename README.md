jquery-bodyviz-poc
==================

Proof of concept integrating bodyviz via iFrame into a web application

A jQuery extension is attaching an iFrame to a page element and exports 
functions to control the frames content. See index.html

Installation
------------

Opening index.html from disk won't work due to same-origin policy for frames.
Needs to be deployed to a web server like Apache2, but can be served statically.
